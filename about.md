At the time starting this weblog I was working as a JAVA EE developer. So I had to continuously work out new technologies or analyse solutions for certain problems. After some time I had the problem to don’t remember why I solved some things the way I’ve done it. So I decided to start writing a weblog as a personal notebook.
